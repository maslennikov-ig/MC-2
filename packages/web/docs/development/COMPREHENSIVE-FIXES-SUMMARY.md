- ✅ Added rate limiting to public API endpoints
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports

### Low - Maintenance
- ✅ Reviewed commented code (found to be valid JSX comments)
- ✅ Verified TODO tracking system

## 📊 Final Validation Results

```bash
pnpm type-check: ✅ 0 errors
pnpm lint:       ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

## 🔒 Required Environment Variables

```env
# Add these to production
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<new_token_after_rotation>
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=166848328
ALLOW_DEV_BYPASS=false  # NEVER set true in production
```
