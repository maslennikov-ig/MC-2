{"course_title":"Introduction to Python Programming","course_description":"A hands-on, beginner-friendly technical course that teaches the fundamentals of Python 3.x syntax, control flow, data structures, functions, file I/O, and error handling through short lectures and 40+ interactive coding labs. Learners write and debug real scripts from day one, culminating in a capstone project that ingests CSV data, cleans it, and outputs summary statistics.","course_overview":"The course is structured in five progressive modules. Module 1 covers environment setup (VS Code,venv,git), syntax basics, variables, and numeric/string operations with micro-labs such as a compound-interest calculator. Module 2 dives into control flow: if/elif, while/for loops, list comprehensions, and the random module while building a console-based number-guessing game. Module 3 explores core data structures—lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries—through practical examples like a grade-book dictionary and set operations that find unique visitors to a website. Module 4 introduces functions, lambda expressions, file handling (CSV, JSON), and exception handling; learners create a reusable logging decorator and write a script that merges two CSV files into one cleaned file. Module 5 focuses on code style (PEP 8), debugging with pdb, unit testing with pytest, and packaging; the final capstone asks learners to fetch a public COVID dataset, sanitize missing values, compute weekly averages, and export results together with a README and requirements.txt. Weekly quizzes auto-grade syntax accuracy, and peer reviews evaluate code readability. By the end, participants will have a GitHub portfolio containing at least four reproducible Python scripts demonstrating variables, control flow, functions, and file I/O.","target_audience":"1) Career-switchers with zero coding background who want to enter data or web development roles within 12 months. 2) University freshmen in non-CS STEM majors who need Python for statistics or research projects. 3) Quality-assurance testers seeking to automate repetitive tasks and transition into SDET positions. 4) Product managers who regularly interact with engineering teams and want to read or prototype Python scripts.","estimated_duration_hours":32,"difficulty_level":"beginner","prerequisites":["Basic computer literacy: create folders, install software, and browse the web","High-school algebra: understand variables and order of operations","Access to a computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux) with administrator rights for installing Python 3.x and VS Code"],"learning_outcomes":["Define and apply Python primitive data types, operators, and variables to solve arithmetic and string manipulation problems","Build interactive programs that utilize conditional statements and iteration to control program flow and validate user input","Create reusable functions with parameters, return values, and comprehensive docstrings following PEP 257 conventions","Analyze runtime errors by interpreting tracebacks and implement try-except blocks to handle file and user input exceptions","Design programs that read from and write to text, CSV, and JSON files, ensuring proper resource cleanup with context managers","Evaluate code quality by writing unit tests with pytest and refactoring scripts to comply with PEP 8 style guidelines","Synthesize concepts into a capstone project that ingests raw data, processes it using lists/dictionaries, and exports summary results"],"course_tags":["Python","programming","beginner","scripting","data cleaning","CSV","functions","control flow","automation","git","VS Code"]}
