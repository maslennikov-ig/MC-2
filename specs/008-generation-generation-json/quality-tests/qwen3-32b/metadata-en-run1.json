  "course_description": "A beginner-friendly technical course designed to teach fundamental programming concepts using Python. Students will gain hands-on experience writing scripts, solving problems, and building simple applications while learning core syntax, data structures, and essential libraries. The curriculum emphasizes practical coding skills and logical thinking for those new to software development.",
  "course_overview": "This course starts with Python fundamentals including installation, variables, and data types (integers, strings, booleans). Through interactive exercises, students will master control structures like loops and conditionals, then progress to functions, modules, and object-oriented programming basics. Specific examples include writing a 'Hello, World!' script, building a temperature conversion tool with user input, and creating a basic calculator. The course also covers file handling (reading/writing CSV/JSON files) and error handling techniques. Students will complete a capstone project: a command-line inventory management system using dictionaries and lists. Additional topics include NumPy/Pandas basics for data analysis and automation scripts for repetitive tasks. All examples use real
