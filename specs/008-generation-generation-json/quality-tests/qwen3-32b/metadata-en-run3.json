  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "A beginner-level technical programming course designed to equip students with foundational Python skills. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, learners will master core programming concepts including syntax, data structures, control flow, and functions while building practical applications.",
  "course_overview": "This course begins with Python installation and setup, then progresses through essential programming principles. Students will explore variable types, loops (for/while), conditional logic (if/elif/else), and error handling. The curriculum includes creating reusable functions, manipulating lists/dictionaries/tuples, and working with file I/O operations. Advanced modules cover object-oriented programming basics, simple data visualization with Matplotlib, and API interactions using the Requests library. Specific projects include building a text-based to-do list manager, developing a weather data analyzer with CSV processing, and constructing a basic calculator with operator precedence handling. The course emphasizes iterative problem-solving through debugging sessions and code optimization challenges.",
  "target_audience": "Aspiring programmers with no prior coding experience, high school students pursuing computer science fundamentals, career changers from non-technical backgrounds, and professionals in fields like biology, finance, or engineering needing automation skills. Ideal for individuals comfortable with basic computer navigation and logical reasoning.",
