 {"section_number":1,"section_title":"Variables and Data Types in Python","section_description":"This hands-on programming section provides comprehensive coverage of Python's fundamental data structures and variable management. Students will explore variable creation and naming conventions, master core data types including numeric values, strings, lists, and dictionaries, and learn essential type conversion techniques. Through practical exercises, learners will develop the skills to store, manipulate, and transform data effectively in Python programs, establishing a solid foundation for more advanced programming concepts.","learning_objectives":["Create and assign variables following Python naming conventions and best practices","Differentiate between integer, float, and complex number types and perform arithmetic operations","Manipulate string data using indexing, slicing, and built-in string methods","Construct and modify lists and dictionaries to store collections of data","Convert between data types safely and handle user input in Python programs"],"lessons":[{"lesson_number":1,"lesson_title":"Mastering Variable Assignment and Naming Conventions","lesson_objective":"Students will correctly create variables using valid identifiers and demonstrate understanding of Python naming conventions through properly named variables for different use cases","key_topics":["Variable creation and assignment operators","Valid identifier rules and reserved keywords","Naming conventions: snake_case, UPPER_CASE, and _private conventions","Dynamic typing and variable reassignment","Using meaningful variable names for code readability"],"exercises":[{"exercise_title":"Create Descriptive Variables for a User Profile","exercise_instructions":"Create variables to store a user's information: username (string), age (integer), is_active (boolean), and account_balance (float).
