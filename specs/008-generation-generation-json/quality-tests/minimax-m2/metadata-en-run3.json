  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This comprehensive beginner-level course provides a solid foundation in Python programming, one of the world's most versatile and in-demand programming languages. Students will master fundamental concepts including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming principles. The course emphasizes hands-on practice through real-world projects and coding exercises, ensuring students develop both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Through systematic progression from basic syntax to advanced concepts, learners will build the confidence and competence needed to create functional Python applications, analyze code problems, and continue their programming journey.",
  "course_overview": "The Introduction to Python Programming course is structured as a comprehensive learning journey designed for absolute beginners in software development. The course begins with Python fundamentals, covering installation, basic syntax, variables, and data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries). Students then progress through control structures including conditional statements (if/else), loops (for/while), and logical operators. Functions and modules are introduced to teach code organization and reusability, with practical examples like creating a calculator program and a simple contact management system. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation are covered through hands-on projects like building a student grade management system. The course concludes with file handling, error handling, and basic web development using Flask. Each module includes practical coding exercises, programming challenges, and mini-projects to reinforce learning. Students will build a complete project portfolio including a to-do list application, a basic web scraper, and a personal finance tracker, demonstrating mastery of Python fundamentals and preparing them for advanced programming topics.",
  "target_audience": "This course is specifically designed for three primary persona types: (1) Complete beginners with no programming experience but basic computer literacy, including career changers from non-technical fields seeking to enter software development, professionals in data analysis wanting to enhance their analytical capabilities, and students from humanities or business backgrounds interested in learning programming fundamentals. (2) Professionals in technical fields (IT support, database administration, system administration) who need to automate repetitive tasks and enhance their problem-solving toolkit with Python scripting capabilities. (3) Students and educators in academic settings, including undergraduate students in non-computer science disciplines who need programming skills for research projects, and K-12 educators seeking to integrate programming concepts into their curriculum. All target audiences share the common goal of building practical programming skills through structured, hands-on learning experiences.",
