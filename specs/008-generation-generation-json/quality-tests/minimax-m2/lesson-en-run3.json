  "section_description": "Hands-on programming section focused on declaring variables, understanding Python's core data types, and performing practical operations. Learners will write short scripts to manipulate numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries while mastering type conversion, common methods, and the differences between mutable and immutable objects.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Declare variables using valid identifiers and apply naming conventions",
    "Distinguish and use int, float, bool, str, list, tuple, set, and dict types",
    "Perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations with numeric and boolean values",
    "Create and modify strings using indexing, slicing, and methods",
    "Build and transform list, tuple, and set collections using comprehensions and methods",
    "Create and query dictionaries for key-value storage and counting patterns",
    "Convert between types safely using int(), float(), str(), bool(), list(), tuple(), set(), and dict()"
