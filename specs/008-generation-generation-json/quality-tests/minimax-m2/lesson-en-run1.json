  "section_description": "This hands-on programming section introduces fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. Students will learn how to create variables, understand Python's built-in data types, perform type conversions, and apply these concepts through practical coding exercises. The section emphasizes real-world application through structured exercises that build progressively from basic variable creation to complex type operations.",
