  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a solid foundation in Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. You will start from absolute zero, learning core programming concepts, syntax, and problem-solving techniques. The course culminates in building practical, real-world applications, equipping you with the skills to automate tasks, analyze data, and begin your journey as a software developer.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive course is designed to take you from a non-programmer to a confident beginner in Python. We begin by setting up your development environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. You will then master fundamental concepts such as variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic operations. The course deeply explores control flow with if/else statements, for and while loops, and logical operators. You will learn to organize your code using functions, parameters, and return values. A significant portion is dedicated to data structures, including lists (for ordered sequences), tuples (for immutable data), dictionaries (for key-value pairs), and sets. You will handle user input, read from and write to files, and implement basic error handling with try/except blocks to make your programs robust. Throughout the course, you will apply these concepts by building projects, such as a simple number-guessing game, a basic to-do list application that saves tasks to a file, and a script that processes a text file to generate a word frequency report. The curriculum emphasizes hands-on coding, best practices, and debugging techniques to solve problems effectively.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; career-changers exploring tech roles; students in non-technical majors seeking a digital skill boost; data analysts in other tools (like Excel) looking to automate tasks; hobbyists interested in understanding how software works.",
