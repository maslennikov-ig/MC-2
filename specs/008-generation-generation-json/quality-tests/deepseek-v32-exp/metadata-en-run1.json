  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a foundational understanding of the Python language. You will master core programming concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and basic data structures. The course emphasizes hands-on learning, guiding you from writing your first simple scripts to building practical, functional applications. By the end, you will have the skills to automate repetitive tasks, process data, and solve real-world problems using Python.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive course is your first step into the world of programming with Python, one of the most popular and versatile languages. We start from absolute zero, ensuring no prior experience is necessary. You will begin by setting up your development environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. We will then dive deep into Python's syntax, exploring variables to store information, different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), and operators to manipulate them. You will learn to control your program's flow using conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for and while) to automate repetitive tasks. The course dedicates significant time to functions, teaching you how to write reusable blocks of code to make your programs more organized and efficient. You will work extensively with fundamental data structures like lists for ordered collections, dictionaries for key-value pairs, and tuples. Practical application is key; for example, you will build a number guessing game, a simple to-do list manager, and a program that reads data from a text file to generate a report. The final module focuses on error handling with try/except blocks, ensuring your programs can gracefully handle unexpected situations. By the conclusion, you will have a solid programming foundation and a portfolio of small projects.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; professionals from non-technical fields (e.g., marketers, researchers, project managers) seeking to automate tasks and analyze data; students preparing for more advanced computer science studies; and hobbyists interested in understanding how software works.",
