  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a thorough introduction to Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages today. Designed for absolute novices, it covers essential concepts including syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and introductory object-oriented programming. Through interactive lessons, coding exercises, and real-world projects, participants will gain practical skills to write, debug, and execute Python code. Python's simplicity makes it ideal for beginners, and this course prepares learners for applications in web development, data analysis, automation, and more. By the end, students will have the confidence to tackle intermediate topics and build their own programs, fostering a strong foundation for a career in software development or personal coding projects.",
  "course_overview": "Introduction to Python Programming is a structured, hands-on course that equips beginners with the core skills needed to start coding effectively in Python. The curriculum is divided into modules for progressive learning. Module 1 focuses on setup and basics: installing Python, using an IDE like IDLE or Jupyter Notebook, and understanding syntax rules, variables, and primitive data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans). Examples include writing a script to calculate the area of a circle using input from users. Module 2 explores data structures and operations: lists for storing sequences, tuples for immutable data, dictionaries for key-value pairs, and sets for unique elements. Practical exercises involve creating a shopping list manager that adds, removes, and searches items. Module 3 delves into control flow: conditional statements (if-elif-else) for decision-making, and loops (for and while) for iteration, with examples like a number guessing game that uses random modules and user input validation. Error handling is introduced via try-except blocks to manage exceptions gracefully. Module 4 covers functions: defining reusable code blocks with parameters, return values, and scope, demonstrated by building a function to compute factorial or sort a list. Modules 5 and 6 introduce file I/O for reading/writing text files, such as a program that logs daily expenses to a CSV, and basic modules like math and random for enhanced functionality. The course culminates in object-oriented programming (OOP) basics: creating classes, instances, attributes, and methods, with a project like designing a BankAccount class for managing deposits and withdrawals. Throughout, learners engage in quizzes, debugging challenges, and a capstone project—a simple inventory system for a store. This 30-hour course emphasizes best practices like code readability and documentation, preparing participants for real-world coding scenarios and further studies in areas like data science or web frameworks such as Django.",
  "target_audience": "This course targets complete beginners eager to enter the world of programming. Specific personas include: career changers like a 35-year-old marketing analyst from a non-technical background seeking to automate data tasks and transition into tech roles; college students or recent graduates in fields like business or liberal arts exploring computer science as a major or for job market edge; high school enthusiasts curious about coding for robotics clubs or personal apps; and hobbyists such as teachers wanting to integrate programming into classroom activities or writers automating manuscript formatting. No prior coding experience is needed, but basic computer navigation skills are assumed.",
