  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a thorough introduction to Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages. Participants will explore core concepts including variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, functions, and modules. Through interactive coding exercises, real-world examples, and hands-on projects like building a simple calculator or a text-based adventure game, learners will develop essential programming skills. The course emphasizes clean code practices, debugging techniques, and problem-solving strategies, preparing students for intermediate programming topics or entry-level software development roles. No prior coding experience is required, making it accessible for newcomers eager to enter the world of technology.",
  "course_overview": "The Introduction to Python Programming course is structured to guide absolute beginners through the essentials of coding in Python, fostering confidence and practical proficiency. Starting with an overview of Python's history, installation, and integrated development environments (IDEs) like IDLE or VS Code, the course quickly moves into foundational syntax. Learners will begin by writing simple 'Hello, World!' programs to understand print statements and basic input/output operations.\n\nModule 1 covers variables and data types, where students practice declaring integers, floats, strings, and booleans, and perform operations like arithmetic and string concatenation. For example, participants might create a program to calculate the area of a circle using the formula pi * r^2, incorporating user input for the radius.\n\nIn Module 2, control structures are introduced with if-else statements and loops. A specific example includes building a number guessing game that uses conditional logic to provide hints like 'too high' or 'too low,' and a while loop to continue until the correct guess. For loops are applied to iterate over lists, such as processing a shopping list to compute totals.\n\nModule 3 focuses on functions, teaching how to define reusable code blocks with parameters and return values. Students will refactor earlier exercises into functions, like a modular tip calculator that accepts bill amount and tip percentage.\n\nData structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are explored in Module 4, with hands-on tasks such as sorting a list of student grades or using dictionaries to store contact information in a simple phonebook application.\n\nThe course culminates in Module 5 with introductory object-oriented programming, where learners create classes for real-world entities, such as a 'Car' class with attributes like speed and methods to accelerate or brake. A capstone project involves developing a basic inventory management system for a store, integrating all learned concepts.\n\nThroughout, emphasis is placed on error handling, code readability with PEP 8 style guidelines, and using libraries like random and math. Weekly quizzes, coding challenges on platforms like Replit, and peer-reviewed assignments ensure active engagement. By the end, students will have a portfolio of Python scripts demonstrating their ability to solve everyday problems programmatically, setting a solid foundation for advanced topics like web development with Flask or data analysis with Pandas.",
  "target_audience": "This course targets complete programming novices, including high school or college students exploring computer science as a major or elective; career changers from non-technical backgrounds such as teachers, marketers, or administrative professionals seeking to transition into tech roles like junior developer or data analyst; and hobbyists or self-learners, like writers automating repetitive tasks or small business owners building custom tools for inventory tracking. Ideal for individuals with basic computer skills but no coding experience, who are motivated to grasp logical thinking and problem-solving through hands-on practice.",
