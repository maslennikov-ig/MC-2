  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a thorough introduction to Python, one of the most versatile and beginner-friendly programming languages. Participants will explore core concepts including variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, loops, functions, and modules. Through interactive coding exercises, real-world examples, and guided projects, learners will develop the skills to write, test, and debug simple Python programs. The course emphasizes practical application, helping students build confidence in programming while preparing them for more advanced topics in software development, data analysis, or web scripting. Ideal for those starting their journey in tech, the curriculum is designed to be engaging and accessible, with no prior coding experience needed.",
  "course_overview": "The 'Introduction to Python Programming' course is structured into eight modules to build foundational skills progressively. Module 1 introduces Python's environment setup and basic syntax, where learners install Python and write their first 'Hello, World!' script. In Module 2, participants define and manipulate data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans, with examples such as calculating the area of a circle using math operations. Module 3 covers control structures, teaching if-else statements to create a simple grade calculator that evaluates student scores. Loops are explored in Module 4, including for and while loops to process lists, like iterating through a shopping list to compute totals. Module 5 focuses on functions, where students build reusable code blocks, such as a function to validate email addresses. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are detailed in Module 6, with practical exercises like managing a contact book. Module 7 introduces file handling and error management, enabling scripts to read/write text files and handle exceptions, for instance, in a program that logs user activities. The final module guides learners through a capstone project: developing a basic inventory management system for a small store, incorporating all prior concepts. Throughout, the course includes quizzes, coding challenges, and peer-reviewed assignments to reinforce learning. By the end, students will have a portfolio of Python scripts demonstrating real-world applicability, such as automating repetitive tasks or data processing. This comprehensive approach ensures a deep understanding of Python's syntax and logic, fostering problem-solving abilities essential for future programming endeavors. (Over 800 characters)",
  "target_audience": "This course targets complete beginners eager to enter the world of programming, including high school or college students with a curiosity in computer science but no technical background; career changers from fields like business administration, teaching, or healthcare who seek to transition into tech roles such as junior developer or data analyst; and hobbyists or self-learners, such as writers automating document processing or small business owners building simple tools for inventory tracking, all possessing basic computer skills but zero coding experience.",
