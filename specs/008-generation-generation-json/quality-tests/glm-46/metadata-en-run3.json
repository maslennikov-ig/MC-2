  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This comprehensive beginner-level course introduces students to Python programming, one of the most versatile and in-demand programming languages today. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts, Python syntax, and practical applications through hands-on coding exercises and real-world projects. The course covers everything from basic variables and data types to control structures, functions, and introductory object-oriented programming concepts, preparing students for further study in software development, data science, or automation.",
  "course_overview": "Introduction to Python Programming provides a solid foundation in computer programming using Python, focusing on practical skills and theoretical understanding. The course begins with setting up the Python development environment and writing your first program. Students will explore Python's core concepts including variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries). The curriculum progresses through control flow mechanisms such as conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for, while), teaching students to make decisions and repeat actions in code. Function definition and usage are covered extensively, including parameters, return values, and scope. Students will work with file operations to read from and write to files, handle exceptions gracefully, and understand error handling strategies. The course introduces basic object-oriented programming concepts, including classes and objects, allowing students to organize code efficiently. Practical projects include building a simple calculator, creating a text-based game, developing data processing scripts, and automating repetitive tasks. By the end of the course, students will have completed several mini-projects demonstrating their ability to apply Python concepts to solve real problems.",
