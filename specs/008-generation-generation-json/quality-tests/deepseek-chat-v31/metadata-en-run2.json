  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "A foundational course designed for absolute beginners to learn the core principles of Python programming. You will master essential concepts like variables, data structures, control flow, and functions. Through hands-on projects, you'll build practical applications, including a simple game, a data analysis script, and an automated task, setting a solid foundation for future development.",
  "course_overview": "This course provides a comprehensive, project-based introduction to the Python programming language. We start from the absolute basics, guiding you through installation and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. You will then explore core programming constructs, including variables and data types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries), and learn to control your program's flow with conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for, while). The course dedicates significant time to functions, teaching you how to define your own to write modular and reusable code. Practical application is emphasized throughout; for example, you will build a number guessing game to practice control flow, create a to-do list manager using lists and functions, and write a script to read and analyze a CSV file. By the end, you will have the confidence and skills to automate simple tasks, analyze data sets, and continue your journey into specialized fields like web development or data science.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience, career changers looking to enter the tech industry, students seeking a first programming language, and professionals in non-technical roles (e.g., marketers, researchers) who want to automate tasks and analyze data.",
