  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-friendly course provides a solid foundation in Python, one of the world's most popular programming languages. You'll learn core programming concepts, data structures, and how to build practical scripts. By the end, you'll be able to automate tasks, analyze data, and create your own basic applications, setting the stage for further specialization in data science, web development, or automation.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive course takes you from absolute beginner to a confident Python programmer. You will start by writing your first 'Hello, World!' program and setting up your development environment. We will then dive into fundamental concepts like variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries), and control flow using conditionals (if/elif/else statements) and loops (for and while). You'll learn to organize your code with functions and modules, and handle errors with try/except blocks. Practical application is key: you'll build a number guessing game, a simple text-based calculator, a to-do list manager that saves data to a file, and a script to automate renaming multiple files. The course also introduces essential libraries, such as using the `requests` module to fetch data from a website and the `csv` module to read and write spreadsheet data.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; professionals in non-technical roles (e.g., marketers, analysts, administrators) seeking to automate tasks; students preparing for more advanced computer science or data science coursework; and hobbyists interested in understanding the basics of programming.",
