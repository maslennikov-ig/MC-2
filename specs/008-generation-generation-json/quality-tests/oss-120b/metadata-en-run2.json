  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course introduces learners to the core concepts of Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages today. Participants will explore syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and basic libraries, gaining practical skills to write, test, and debug simple Python scripts. The course emphasizes hands‑on exercises, real‑world examples, and clear explanations to build confidence for further study or immediate application in personal projects and entry‑level roles.",
  "course_overview": "The course is organized into six progressive modules. Module 1 covers the Python development environment, installing the interpreter, and writing the first \"Hello, World!\" program, demonstrating how to run scripts from the command line and an IDE. Module 2 dives into fundamental data types—strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, and dictionaries—through examples such as manipulating a list of student grades and formatting output. Module 3 introduces control flow with if/elif/else statements and loops, illustrated by a program that calculates the factorial of a number and a script that filters even numbers from a range. Module 4 focuses on functions, parameters, return values, and modular code, guiding learners to refactor a repetitive temperature conversion script into reusable functions. Module 5 explores basic file I/O and the csv module, enabling students to read, process, and write a simple contacts database. Module 6 brings everything together in a capstone project: building a command‑line calculator that parses user input, performs arithmetic operations, and visualizes results using the matplotlib library. Throughout, learners receive step‑by‑step explanations, code walkthroughs, and quizzes to reinforce understanding, ensuring they can confidently write, debug, and extend Python programs in real contexts.",
