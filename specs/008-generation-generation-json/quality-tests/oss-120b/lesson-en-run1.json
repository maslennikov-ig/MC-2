{"section_number":1,"section_title":"Variables and Data Types in Python","section_description":"This section provides a hands‑on exploration of Python's core data types and variable assignment. Students will learn how to declare variables, understand type inference, convert between types, and apply these concepts in practical coding exercises. The section culminates in creating a simple data processing script that demonstrates variable scope, mutable vs. immutable types, and type casting.","learning_objectives":["Students will be able to declare and assign variables of different data types in Python.","Students will be able to identify and convert between numeric, string, and boolean types.","Students will be able to explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects and apply this knowledge in code.","Students will be able to use type casting functions to transform data types in real-world scenarios."]}
