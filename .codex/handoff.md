# Orchestrator Handoff

Updated: 2026-08-09. Effective kernel: `shared-orchestration/v1`.
Current stage id: `mc2-jsamu`

## Current stage

`mc2-jsamu` is accepted locally as a root-owned repo-health stage. It was restructured before formatting:
`.2` preserves and excludes the 11 raw LLM captures, and new child `.7` owns repository metadata,
caches, installed agent assets, immutable stage evidence, generated outputs, and the 28 paths that
previously belonged to no child. The remaining measured batches are docs 29, specs 1, and packages 74. All scoped checks, global format-check, type-check, build, process verification, and stage
readiness pass. Repository delivery is pending.

The previous off-host Qdrant stage is delivered and deployed through green pipelines. Production
health is green, `helixa-new` retains three verified generations under the 14-day/14-copy bound,
and both backup and restore timers remain enabled.

## Backlog truth and order

`specs/026-post-triage-priorities/spec.md` supersedes the older stage order. The checked backlog
contains 49 work items plus 5 epics; do not re-open the 27 already closed with a commit or a
measurement, and do not re-rank by tracker priority.

Tier 1 is complete through `mc2-sznhi`; Tier 2 is complete through `mc2-3sz3d`; Tier 3 is complete
through `mc2-jz6y0.13.6`. Tier 4 is active at `mc2-jsamu`; after it closes, the next exact item is
`mc2-5dzld`.

## Verification facts

- The default backend Vitest command is now fail-closed: an unmet Qdrant precondition and an empty
  run exit nonzero. It still requires the pinned Qdrant 1.18.2 precondition unless the operator
  explicitly sets `SKIP_QDRANT_TEST_SETUP=1`; use `vitest.config.unit.ts` for focused unit tests.
- Web tests work.
- Typical code gates are `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm build`.
- Repository deploy/rollback entrypoints now fail with exit 75 when
  `/opt/megacampus/.host-operation.lock` is held; manual infrastructure work must use
  `scripts/with_host_operation_lock.sh` to participate.
- `mc2-jsamu` reproduced 138 format mismatches plus 11 raw-capture parse blockers. Narrow ignores
  removed all blockers; the 104 owned formatting files and global format/type/build acceptance are
  green.
- Before claiming delivery, run `scripts/orchestration/check_stranded_commits.py`.

## Live operational facts

- Uploads have a daily pull-based off-host copy on `helixa-new`; restore of one file matched
  `file_catalog.hash`. It is a second machine, not full disaster recovery.
- Qdrant now has a separate daily restricted pull to `helixa-new`: the measured generation is
  142,585,344 bytes with matching SHA-256, 14-day/14-copy bounds, exact incoming-size reservation
  above a 10 GiB free-space floor, and low CPU/I/O priority. Three generations occupy 409 MiB with
  48 GiB free. The exact digest-pinned 1.18.2 restore returned all 13,712 points green; both timers
  are enabled. Root-owned off-host metrics cannot be replaced by UID 1001. Production Prometheus
  scrapes independent backup/restore timestamps, and both Telegram-routed rules are healthy.
- Nine source documents are accepted as lost; do not reopen them.
- Production Qdrant answers on host port 6335; 6333 is the empty dev instance.
- Monitoring drift is a separate job and must never become a deploy step because that can trigger
  rollback on configuration drift.
- `AGENTS.md` is rewritten by a `bd` hook: stage and commit explicit paths, never `git add -A`.

## Owner decisions

- `mc2-jz6y0.13.6` — answered: use pull-based off-host snapshots on `helixa-new`, 14-day bounded retention, and low resource priority.
- `mc2-db696.61` — needs a live run and a cost/quality decision.
- `mc2-db696.11.6` — needs disposable staging resources and an approved LLM budget.

## Safety boundary

Do not perform reindex, schema migrations, force-push, or any secrets/access change outside the
explicitly authorized `mc2-2vtmk` GHCR credential repair. Deploy only under the standing
authorization and only on a green pipeline. Do not run live paid work without a specific current
budget/authority.

Do not touch `mc2-x72bq`, `mc2-ibzcc`, `mc2-vlskb`, `mc2-hqfc3`, `mc2-8m90f`, `mc2-qd12b`,
`mc2-1nots`, or `mc2-5e4ek.1`; see §9 of the active spec for exact reopen gates.

## Explicit defers

- Beads task `mc2-xq2w0` — make the closeout debt-marker scan distinguish intentional
  `TODO`/`FIXME` test literals from new production debt; current formatting preserves those
  validator fixtures unchanged in meaning.
- Beads task `mc2-vr7ic` — make the pre-commit hook handle formatting-only legacy batches and
  deliberately tracked `.codex/goals` snapshots without requiring unrelated lint cleanup or a
  manual hook bypass.
- `mc2-3gz2m` — unreadable vector diagrams; gated on
  `specs/025-remaining-debt/research-prompt.md`.
- `mc2-db696.61`, `mc2-db696.11.6` — owner decisions above.
- `mc2-p2908.1` — trace the existing Node `DEP0169 url.parse()` warning emitted by Next.js
  page-data workers during an otherwise successful production build.
- Separate deploy accounts and narrower sudoers — intentionally not planned after `mc2-q1ggs`;
  reconsider only if another regular production operator appears.
- `mc2-x72bq`, `mc2-ibzcc`, `mc2-vlskb`, `mc2-hqfc3`, `mc2-8m90f`, `mc2-qd12b`, `mc2-1nots`,
  `mc2-5e4ek.1` — excluded by §9, with repository or owner gates already recorded.

## Next recommended

Accepted stage id: `mc2-jsamu`
Next stage id: `mc2-5dzld`
Recommended action: deliver accepted `mc2-jsamu` through `develop`, wait for exact green CI, then
start `mc2-5dzld`.

## Starter prompt for next orchestrator

Use $orchestrator-stage for the current Codex task.

The current item `mc2-jsamu` is accepted locally and pending normal develop delivery. After exact
green CI, the next ordered item is `mc2-5dzld`. Do not reindex, migrate, force-push, perform paid
work, or deploy before a green pipeline.
