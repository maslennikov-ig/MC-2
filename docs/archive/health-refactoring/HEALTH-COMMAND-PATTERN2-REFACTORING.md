# Health Command Refactoring: Pattern 2 Compliance

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Architectural Alignment:** Pattern 2 (Automatic Delegation)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully refactored `/health` command to comply with **Pattern 2: Automatic Delegation** from the AI Agents Architecture Guide. The command now describes **tasks and phases** instead of **naming agents explicitly**, enabling Claude's automatic agent invocation mechanism.

---

## Problem Identified

### ❌ Previous Implementation (Violation of Pattern 2)

**File:** `.claude/commands/health.md.old` (142 lines)

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Explicit Agent Naming Throughout**

   ```markdown
   The code-health-orchestrator will be automatically invoked in quick mode to:
   The bug-orchestrator will be automatically invoked to:
   The security-orchestrator will be automatically invoked to:
   ```

2. **Wrong Focus**: Command described WHO does work, not WHAT needs to be done

3. **No Phase Structure**: Simple list format instead of structured phases

4. **Violates Architecture Guide**: Lines 170-206 specify commands should describe tasks, not agents

### Reference: Architecture Guide Requirements

From `docs/ai-agents-architecture-guide.md` (lines 174-204):

```markdown
# .claude/commands/release.md

Your task:

## Phase 1: Preparation

Run the bash release script...

## Phase 2: AI Version Updates

The version-updater agent will automatically handle finding and updating...

Wait for version-updater completion before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Finalization

Complete the release with git operations...
```

**Key Pattern:**

- Describe **phases and tasks**
- Agent mentioned AFTER task description
- Focus on **actions**, not agent names
- Use "Wait for completion" pattern

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ New Implementation (Pattern 2 Compliant)

**File:** `.claude/commands/health.md` (215 lines)

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Task-Focused Structure**

   ```markdown
   ### Quick Mode

   **Phase 1: Critical Issues Analysis**

   Analyze and fix critical issues across two domains in parallel:

   1. **Bug Detection**: Scan for Priority 1 bugs (type errors, crashes)
   2. **Security Audit**: Check for Critical/High vulnerabilities
   ```

2. **Phase-Based Organization**
   - Each mode broken into clear phases
   - Actions described first, agents mentioned minimally
   - Structured workflow with expected outputs

3. **Automatic Delegation Ready**
   - Claude can now automatically invoke appropriate orchestrators
   - Context-based matching will work correctly
   - No explicit Task tool usage mentioned

---

## Detailed Changes

### Section 1: Mode Descriptions (Unchanged)

Lines 1-56 describe available modes - kept as-is because they provide user context, not execution instructions.

### Section 2: Execution Instructions (Completely Rewritten)

**Before (lines 59-113):**

```markdown
## Execution

**If mode is 'quick':**
The code-health-orchestrator will be automatically invoked in quick mode to:

- Analyze critical bugs only (Priority 1)
- Check critical/high security vulnerabilities
- Run parallel execution (bugs + security)
- Generate code-health-summary.md with unified health score
```

**After (lines 59-165):**

```markdown
## Your Task

Based on mode parameter '$1':

### Quick Mode

**Phase 1: Critical Issues Analysis**

Analyze and fix critical issues across two domains in parallel:

1. **Bug Detection**: Scan for Priority 1 bugs (type errors, crashes)
2. **Security Audit**: Check for Critical/High vulnerabilities

For each domain:

- Run comprehensive scan
- Fix issues by priority
- Validate with type-check and build
- Generate health report

**Output**: `code-health-summary.md` with unified health score
```

### Section 3: Examples & Output (Enhanced)

Lines 168-194: Added more structured information about expected outputs and important notes.

### Section 4: Important Notes (New Section)

Lines 197-215: Added execution strategy, quality gates, and progress tracking details.

## Architectural Compliance Verification

### ✅ Pattern 2: Automatic Delegation

From Architecture Guide (lines 170-206):

| Requirement                 | Compliance | Evidence                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Describe phases, not agents | ✅ YES     | Lines 63-165 use "Phase 1", "Phase 2" |
| Focus on tasks              | ✅ YES     | "Analyze and fix critical issues..."  |
| Minimal agent naming        | ✅ YES     | Agents only in "Important Notes"      |
| Wait for completion         | ✅ YES     | Phase 2 says "after Phase 1"          |
| Structured workflow         | ✅ YES     | Each mode has clear phases            |

### ❌ Anti-Patterns Avoided

| Anti-Pattern             | Status     | Evidence                   |

| "Launch @agent"          | ✅ REMOVED | No "Launch" in new version |
| "Use Task tool"          | ✅ AVOIDED | No Task tool mentions      |
| Agent-first descriptions | ✅ FIXED   | Task-first descriptions    |

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Quick Mode:**

   ```bash
   /health quick
   ```

   **Expected:** Claude automatically invokes code-health-orchestrator in quick mode

2. **Test Domain-Specific Mode:**

   ```bash
   /health bugs
   ```

   **Expected:** Claude automatically invokes bug-orchestrator

3. **Test Full Mode:**
   ```bash
   /health full
   ```
   **Expected:** Claude coordinates phased execution

### Validation Checks

- [ ] Claude recognizes task context correctly
- [ ] Appropriate orchestrator auto-invoked
- [ ] Phase structure followed
- [ ] Reports generated as expected
- [ ] No explicit Task tool usage needed

### Behavioral Changes

1. **Claude now auto-invokes orchestrators** based on task context (correct behavior)
2. **More structured phase execution** (improvement)
3. **Clearer progress tracking** (improvement)

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Full compatibility** - users can still run `/health quick`, `/health full`, etc.

The `/health` command now fully complies with Pattern 2: Automatic Delegation from the AI Agents Architecture Guide. Claude can now automatically invoke the appropriate orchestrators based on task context, following the proven pattern used in the `/release` command.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Commands describe WHAT, not WHO**: Focus on tasks and phases, not agent names
2. **Phase-based structure works**: Clear phases make workflows easier to understand
3. **Automatic delegation is powerful**: Let Claude invoke agents based on context
4. **Consistency matters**: Following the pattern across all commands creates predictable behavior
