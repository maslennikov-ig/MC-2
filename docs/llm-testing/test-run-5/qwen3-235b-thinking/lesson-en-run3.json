  "section_description": "This section covers the foundational concepts of storing and manipulating data in Python through variables and core data types. You'll learn how to declare variables, understand different data categories, and perform basic operations. By the end, you'll be equipped to handle data effectively in simple Python programs.",

    "Declare and assign values to variables following Python naming conventions",
    "Identify and use the four core data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans",
