  "section_description": "This section covers the foundational concepts of storing and manipulating data in Python through variables and core data types. You'll learn how to declare variables, understand different data categories, and perform basic operations. By the end, you'll be equipped to handle essential data structures for simple programming tasks.",

    "Declare and initialize variables using valid Python naming conventions",
    "Identify and differentiate between integer, float, string, and boolean data types",
    "Perform basic operations including arithmetic calculations and string manipulations",
