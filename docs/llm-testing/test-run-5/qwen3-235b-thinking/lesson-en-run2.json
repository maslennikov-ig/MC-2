  "section_description": "This section covers the foundational concepts of storing and manipulating data in Python through variables and data types. You'll learn how to declare variables, understand naming conventions, and work with core data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. By the end, you'll be able to write basic programs that handle different kinds of data effectively.",

    "Declare and assign values to variables using valid naming conventions",
    "Identify and differentiate between integer, float, string, and boolean data types",
    "Use the type() function to verify the data type of any variable",
    "Convert between basic data types using built-in conversion functions",
    "Apply string concatenation and basic operations on fundamental data types"
