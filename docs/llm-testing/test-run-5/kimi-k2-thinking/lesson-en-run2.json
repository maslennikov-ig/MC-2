{"section_number":1,"section_title":"Variables and Data Types in Python","section_description":"This section introduces the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. You'll learn how to store information in variables and work with different data types including numbers, text, and booleans. By the end, you'll be able to create variables, identify their types, and perform basic operations.","learning_objectives":["Define and create variables in Python using appropriate naming conventions","Identify and utilize four primary data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans","Perform type conversion between compatible data types using built-in functions","Apply the type() function to determine the data type of any variable or value","Demonstrate best practices for variable naming and avoid common syntax errors"],"lessons":[{"lesson_number":1,"lesson_title":"Introduction to Variables","lesson_objective":"Create and assign values to variables using proper Python syntax and naming conventions","key_topics":["What are variables and why we use them","Variable assignment using the = operator","Valid variable naming rules and conventions","Reassigning variables","Printing variables with the print() function"],"exercises":[{"exercise_title":"Your First Variables","exercise_instructions":"Create three variables: name (assign your name as a string), age (assign your age as an integer), and city (assign your city as a string).
