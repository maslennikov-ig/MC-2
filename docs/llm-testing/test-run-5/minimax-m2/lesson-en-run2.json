    "Create variables using valid names and the assignment operator",
    "Use integers, floats, strings, and booleans in code and understand dynamic typing",
    "Apply basic operators for numbers and strings, including f-strings",
    "Convert between int, float, and str using int(), float(), str(), and bool()",
