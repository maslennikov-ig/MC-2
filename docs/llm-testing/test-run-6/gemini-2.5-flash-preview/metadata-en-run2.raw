{"course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming", "course_description": "Kickstart your technical career by mastering Python, the world's most versatile and in-demand programming language. Learn fundamental coding concepts, data structures, and functional programming from scratch.", "course_overview": "This comprehensive, beginner-level course provides a thorough grounding in the Python programming language (version 3). Students will progress from understanding basic syntax and variables to implementing control flow, functions, and working with complex data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. The course emphasizes hands-on coding exercises, problem-solving techniques, and best practices for writing clean, readable code. By the end of the course, learners will be able to write small, functional scripts to automate tasks and solve computational problems, preparing them for more advanced topics like web development or data science.", "target_audience": "Individuals with no prior coding experience, aspiring programmers, analysts looking to automate tasks, and university students seeking a foundational programming skill.", "estimated_duration_hours": 40, "difficulty_level": "beginner", "prerequisites": ["Basic computer literacy", "Comfortable navigating files and folders", "Access to a computer with internet"], "learning_outcomes": ["Define and utilize core Python data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans) and variables.", "Implement control flow structures (if/else statements and loops) to manage program execution.", "Design and write reusable functions to modularize code and improve efficiency.", "Construct and manipulate complex data structures including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.", "Apply basic file input/output (I/O) operations to read from and write to text files.", "Explain the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and differentiate between classes and objects.", "Debug simple Python programs and identify common syntax and runtime errors."], "course_tags": ["Python", "Programming Fundamentals", "Coding", "Beginner", "Scripting", "Data Structures", "Computer Science"]}
