  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "Master Python fundamentals in this hands-on beginner course! Learn core programming concepts through practical exercises and real-world projects. Build executable scripts, manipulate data structures, and solve problems while gaining confidence in coding. No prior experience needed – start your tech career journey today.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive course teaches Python programming from absolute zero. Starting with installation and environment setup, students progress through variables, data types, control flow, functions, and file handling. Through 40+ coding exercises and 5 portfolio projects (including a text-based game and data analyzer), learners develop problem-solving skills using industry-standard tools like VS Code and Git. The curriculum emphasizes clean code practices, debugging techniques, and computational thinking, culminating in object-oriented programming foundations. Includes Python 3.10 syntax, error handling, and best practices for maintainable code.",
