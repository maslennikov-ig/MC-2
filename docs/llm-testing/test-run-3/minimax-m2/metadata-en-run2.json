  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "A hands-on, beginner-friendly course that introduces core Python programming concepts, from variables and data types to control flow, functions, and basic object-oriented programming, preparing learners to write simple scripts and solve real-world problems.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive beginner-level course guides students through the fundamentals of Python programming. It begins with setting up the development environment and covers essential topics such as variables, data types, operators, input/output, control structures (if statements, loops), functions, modules, file handling, and basic object-oriented programming concepts. Each module includes concise video lectures, hands-on coding exercises, and short quizzes to reinforce learning. Learners will complete a mini-project that combines the concepts to build a simple utility program. By the end, students will be able to write clean, efficient Python scripts and have a solid foundation for further study in data science, web development, or automation.",
