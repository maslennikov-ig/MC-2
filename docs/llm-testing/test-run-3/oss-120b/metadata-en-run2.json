  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-friendly course introduces Python fundamentals, guiding learners through variables, data types, control flow, functions, and basic data structures, enabling them to write and run simple programs with confidence.",
  "course_overview": "In this hands-on introductory course, students will explore the core concepts of Python programming through interactive lectures, live coding demos, and practical exercises. Starting with setting up a development environment, the curriculum covers variables, operators, data types, strings, lists, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, functions, and simple file I/O. Learners will practice writing and debugging code in real time, develop small projects such as a calculator and a text-based game, and gain confidence to continue their coding journey. No prior programming experience is required, but participants should be comfortable using a computer and navigating the internet.",
  "target_audience": "Aspiring programmers, students, career changers, or anyone with basic computer skills who wants to learn how to think computationally and create functional software using Python.",
