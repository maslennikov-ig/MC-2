  "section_description": "Master the building blocks of every Python program by learning how to create, name, and use variables to store and manipulate data. You will explore Python’s core data types—numbers, text, and Boolean values—and practice converting between them so you can handle real-world information in your code.",

    "Declare and assign at least five variables with legal, descriptive names following PEP 8 style.",
    "Predict and verify the data type of any literal or variable using type() with 100 % accuracy on a 10-question quiz.",
    "Convert between int, float, str, and bool types without raising errors in three scaffolded coding drills.",
    "Debug and fix NameError and TypeError messages in provided buggy scripts within 2 minutes each."
