{"course_title":"Introduction to Python Programming","course_description":"A hands-on, beginner-friendly course that takes you from zero to writing real Python scripts in just a few weeks.","course_overview":"This course provides a gentle yet thorough entry into programming through Python, the world’s most popular first language. You will explore core concepts—variables, data types, control flow, functions, lists, dictionaries, and file I/O—while building mini-projects that reinforce every topic. Lessons alternate between bite-sized videos, interactive coding labs, and auto-graded challenges so you immediately apply what you learn. By the end, you will have a portfolio of small programs and the confidence to tackle more advanced Python courses or self-directed projects.","target_audience":"Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience who want a practical, supportive first step into programming.","estimated_duration_hours":25,"difficulty_level":"beginner","prerequisites":["Basic computer literacy","Ability to install software on your machine","High-school level algebra"],"learning_outcomes":["Install and configure Python 3 and a code editor on your operating system","Explain and apply variables, data types, and operators to solve simple computational problems","Construct programs using sequential, conditional, and iterative control structures","Decompose tasks into reusable functions with clear parameters and return values","Manipulate lists and dictionaries to store, retrieve, and update collections of data","Read from and write to text files to persist program output","Debug syntax and logic errors using interpreter feedback and strategic print statements","Create a 100-line terminal application that integrates course concepts to solve a real-world task"],"course_tags":["Python","programming","beginner","automation","scripting","coding fundamentals","software development"]}
