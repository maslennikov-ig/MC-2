{"section_number":1,"section_title":"Variables and Data Types in Python","section_description":"This section introduces the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. You'll learn how to store information in variables and work with Python's core data types including strings, numbers, and booleans. By the end, you'll be able to create variables, manipulate different data types, and build simple programs that process user information.","learning_objectives":["Define and create variables using proper Python naming conventions","Identify and use four fundamental data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans","Perform type conversion between compatible data types","Use type() and print() functions to inspect and display variable information","Apply string indexing, slicing, and methods to manipulate text data"],"lessons":[{"lesson_number":1,"lesson_title":"Creating and Using Variables","lesson_objective":"Create and assign values to variables following Python naming conventions","key_topics":["What variables are and why we use them","Assignment operator (=)","Variable naming rules and conventions","Reassigning variables","Using descriptive variable names"],"exercises":[{"exercise_title":"Your First Variables","exercise_instructions":"Create three variables: name (with your name as a string), age (with your age as a number), and city (with your city as a string).
