{"course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming: From Zero to Coder", "course_description": "Learn the fundamentals of programming with Python. Build a strong foundation in coding logic, syntax, and problem-solving to start your journey as a developer.", "course_overview": "This hands-on course is your first step into the world of programming. You'll start with the absolute basics, learning about variables, data types, and simple commands. We'll then guide you through core programming concepts like loops, conditional logic, and functions. You'll apply your new skills by building practical, small-scale projects, such as a simple game or a data analysis script. By the end, you'll be confident in writing your own Python programs and ready to tackle more advanced topics.", "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience, career switchers, students, and professionals seeking to add programming to their skillset.", "estimated_duration_hours": 20, "difficulty_level": "beginner", "prerequisites": ["Basic computer literacy", "No prior programming experience required", "A computer capable of running Python"], "learning_outcomes": ["Define and explain core programming concepts like variables, data types, and control flow.", "Apply Python syntax to write basic scripts that solve simple problems.", "Construct programs using functions to organize code and promote reusability.", "Differentiate between different data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.", "Develop a complete, simple application by combining learned concepts.", "Evaluate and debug code to identify and fix common errors."], "course_tags": ["Python", "Programming", "Beginner", "Coding", "Software Development", "Automation", "Data Types", "Functions"]}
