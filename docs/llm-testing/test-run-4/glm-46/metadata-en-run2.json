  "course_description": "Unlock the world of programming with Python! This beginner-level course provides a solid foundation in core coding concepts, from writing your first script to understanding data structures. No prior experience needed.",
  "course_overview": "Welcome to 'Introduction to Python Programming,' your first step into the versatile and in-demand world of coding. This course is meticulously designed for absolute beginners. We'll start with the absolute basics, including setting up your development environment and writing your first lines of code. You'll then progress to essential programming concepts like variables, data types, operators, control flow (if/else statements, loops), functions, and basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries. Through a mix of concise video lectures, hands-on coding exercises, and small projects, you will build practical, real-world skills. We focus on writing clean, readable code and understanding the 'why' behind the syntax. By the end of this course, you will have the confidence and foundational knowledge to tackle more advanced topics or begin exploring Python's applications in data science, web development, and automation.",
