  "section_description": "This section introduces the foundational elements of Python programming by exploring variables and data types. Learners will discover how to store and manipulate data using variables, and understand the core data types like numbers, strings, and booleans. By completing this section, you'll gain the skills to build simple programs that handle basic data effectively.",

    "Declare and assign variables using proper Python syntax.",
    "Identify and use primitive data types including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.",
    "Perform basic operations and manipulations on different data types.",
    "Apply type conversion techniques to handle data interoperability.",
