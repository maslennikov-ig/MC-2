  "section_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python programming. You will learn how to create, name, and use variables to store different kinds of information, from numbers and text to collections of data. Understanding these core concepts is essential for building more complex programs.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Create and name variables following Python naming conventions and best practices",
    "Distinguish and use different numeric data types (int, float, complex) in calculations",
    "Manipulate text data using string operations and formatting techniques",
    "Apply boolean logic and perform type conversions between different data types",
    "Utilize basic collection types (list, tuple, dict, set) to organize and manage data"
