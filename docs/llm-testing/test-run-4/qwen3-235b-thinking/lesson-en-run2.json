  "section_description": "This section covers the foundational concepts of storing and manipulating data in Python through variables and core data types. Learners will understand how to assign values, recognize different data categories, and perform basic operations. Mastery of these concepts is essential for writing functional Python programs and progressing to more complex topics.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Declare and initialize variables using valid naming conventions",
    "Identify and differentiate between int, float, str, and bool data types",
    "Perform arithmetic operations and string manipulations using appropriate operators",
    "Convert between data types using built-in conversion functions",
    "Predict the output of type-checking operations using the type() function"
