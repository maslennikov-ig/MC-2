  "section_description": "This hands-on programming section immerses students in the fundamentals of variables and data types in Python. Through interactive coding exercises, students will declare variables, explore integer, float, string, and boolean types, perform operations, and handle type conversions, building a strong foundation for writing effective Python code.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Students will be able to declare and assign variables using Python's dynamic typing system.",
    "Students will be able to identify and manipulate basic data types including int, float, str, and bool.",
    "Students will be able to perform arithmetic operations on numeric types and string concatenations.",
    "Students will be able to use type checking and conversion functions to handle data interoperability."
