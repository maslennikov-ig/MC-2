  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a thorough introduction to Python, one of the most accessible and powerful programming languages used in web development, data science, automation, and more. Learners will explore core concepts including variables, data types, control flow, functions, and modules through interactive lessons and practical exercises. The course emphasizes hands-on coding to build confidence, culminating in simple projects like a personal expense tracker or a text-based adventure game. By the end, participants will have the skills to write, test, and debug basic Python programs, setting a solid foundation for further studies in software engineering or related fields. Ideal for newcomers eager to enter the world of coding without overwhelming complexity.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive Introduction to Python Programming course is structured over 10 modules, spanning approximately 40 hours of content, blending video lectures, coding challenges, quizzes, and real-world projects to ensure practical mastery. Starting with Module 1: Setting Up Your Environment, learners install Python and an IDE like VS Code, followed by writing their first 'Hello, World!' script to understand basic syntax and execution. Module 2 dives into Variables and Data Types, covering integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists with examples such as manipulating a shopping list: appending items with list.append('milk') and slicing to display categories. In Module 3: Control Structures, participants implement if-else statements for a grade calculator (e.g., if score >= 90: print('A')) and for/while loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers, simulating a countdown timer. Module 4 introduces Functions, teaching how to define reusable code blocks like def calculate_area(radius): return 3.14 * radius ** 2, applied in a geometry utility program. Modules 5-6 explore Strings and Lists in depth, with string methods like .upper() for text processing and list comprehensions for efficient data handling, exemplified by filtering even numbers from a dataset. Module 7 covers File I/O, where learners read/write CSV files to manage a simple inventory system. Object-Oriented Programming basics in Module 8 include creating classes like class Car: def __init__(self, make): self.make = make, with inheritance examples for vehicle types. Module 9 focuses on Error Handling and Debugging, using try-except blocks to gracefully manage input errors in a user quiz app. The capstone Module 10 guides building a complete project, such as a command-line to-do list manager that stores tasks in files and allows add/delete operations. Throughout, Jupyter notebooks provide interactive practice, and peer-reviewed assignments ensure application of concepts. This structured approach, with specific code snippets and progressive complexity, equips beginners to transition from theory to functional programming skills.",
  "target_audience": "High school students with an interest in computer science but no prior coding experience, seeking to explore STEM careers; career changers from non-technical backgrounds like marketing, teaching, or administration, aiming to pivot into tech roles such as data analysis or automation scripting; hobbyists and self-learners, including parents or retirees, wanting to automate everyday tasks like budgeting or web scraping without formal education in programming.",
