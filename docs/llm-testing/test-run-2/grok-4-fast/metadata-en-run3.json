  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course introduces learners to the fundamentals of Python, one of the most versatile and beginner-friendly programming languages. Participants will explore core concepts including variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, functions, and basic data structures like lists and dictionaries. Through interactive exercises and practical projects, students will develop problem-solving skills and gain the confidence to write simple programs. The course emphasizes hands-on coding practice, debugging techniques, and best practices for readable code. By the end, learners will be equipped to tackle real-world applications, such as automating everyday tasks or analyzing basic datasets, laying a strong foundation for further studies in software development, data science, or web programming. Ideal for those entering the tech field or pursuing personal projects.",
  "course_overview": "The 'Introduction to Python Programming' course is structured into 10 modules, each building progressively on the previous one to ensure a solid grasp of Python fundamentals. Starting with Module 1: Setting Up Your Environment, learners install Python and an IDE like VS Code, followed by writing their first 'Hello, World!' program. Module 2 covers Variables and Data Types, where students practice assigning integers, floats, strings, and booleans, with examples like calculating the area of a circle using math operations. In Module 3: Control Flow, participants implement if-else statements and for/while loops, such as creating a program to check if a number is even or odd, or iterating through a list to sum elements. Functions are introduced in Module 4, teaching how to define reusable code blocks, like a function to compute factorial with parameters and return values. Module 5 dives into Lists and Tuples, with hands-on tasks like sorting a shopping list or accessing tuple elements for data manipulation. Dictionaries and Sets follow in Module 6, exemplified by building a simple phonebook that stores contacts and retrieves information efficiently. Error handling and file I/O are covered in Module 7, where learners write scripts to read from CSV files, like processing a sales report to calculate totals while managing exceptions. Module 8 introduces Modules and Packages, importing libraries such as math or random for enhanced functionality, e.g., generating random passwords. The course culminates in Modules 9 and 10 with capstone projects: developing a text-based adventure game using conditionals and loops, or a basic to-do list app that persists data to files. Each module includes video lectures, quizzes, coding challenges on platforms like Replit, and peer-reviewed assignments. With over 20 hours of content, this course fosters critical thinking through real-world examples, preparing learners for intermediate topics like object-oriented programming or GUI development.",
  "target_audience": "High school students or recent graduates exploring computer science majors, with backgrounds in math or science but no coding experience; career changers from non-technical fields such as teaching, marketing, or administration, seeking to transition into entry-level tech roles like junior developer or data analyst; and hobbyists or self-learners, including writers or small business owners, who want to automate repetitive tasks like data entry or content generation using scripts.",
