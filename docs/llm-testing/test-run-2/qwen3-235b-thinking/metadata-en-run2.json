  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a hands-on introduction to Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. Designed for absolute novices, it covers foundational concepts through practical examples and real-world applications. Students will learn syntax, data structures, control flow, and problem-solving techniques while building executable scripts. The curriculum emphasizes immediate application with exercises ranging from simple calculators to data analysis snippets, preparing learners for further study in software development, automation, or data science. No prior coding experience is required, but basic computer literacy is expected.",
  "course_overview": "This structured 25-hour course begins with Python installation and environment setup using IDLE and Jupyter Notebooks. Module 1 covers variables, data types (integers, strings, booleans), and operators through practical examples like temperature converters and BMI calculators. Module 2 explores control structures with hands-on projects: building a quiz application using if-elif-else statements and creating pattern generators with for/while loops. Module 3 dives into data structures through building a contact management system with lists, a product inventory with dictionaries, and set operations for data deduplication. Module 4 teaches function creation by developing reusable utilities for currency conversion and text analysis. Module 5 implements file I/O operations to process CSV datasets like sales records, while Module 6 introduces error handling via try-except blocks in a user login system. The capstone project combines all concepts to build a weather data analyzer that fetches API results, processes temperature trends, and generates summary reports. Each module includes debugging exercises and incremental coding challenges with automated feedback.",
