  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "A comprehensive beginner-level technical programming course designed to teach the fundamentals of Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. Students will learn core programming concepts, data structures, and problem-solving techniques through hands-on exercises and real-world projects, building a solid foundation for further study in data science, web development, or automation.",
  "course_overview": "This course provides a thorough introduction to Python programming, starting from the absolute basics and progressing to more complex concepts. You will begin by setting up your Python environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. The curriculum then covers fundamental data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans, and teaches you to use variables and perform basic operations. You will master control flow with if/else statements, for loops, and while loops to create logical programs. The course delves into essential data structures including lists for ordered collections, dictionaries for key-value pairs, tuples, and sets. You will learn to define and call your own functions, work with modules to organize code, and handle files for reading and writing data. Practical projects include building a simple text-based calculator, creating a to-do list application, and developing a number guessing game. The final module introduces error handling with try/except blocks to write robust code. Through a combination of video lectures, coding exercises, and mini-projects, you will gain the confidence to write functional Python scripts and automate simple tasks.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience, career changers looking to enter the tech industry, students in non-STEM fields seeking to add technical skills, administrative professionals aiming to automate repetitive tasks, and hobbyists interested in understanding how software works.",
