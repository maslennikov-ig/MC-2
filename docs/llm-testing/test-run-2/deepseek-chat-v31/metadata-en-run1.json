  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-friendly course provides a comprehensive foundation in Python programming. You'll learn core programming concepts, data structures, and problem-solving techniques through hands-on exercises. The curriculum covers everything from basic syntax to writing functional scripts, enabling you to automate tasks and build simple applications. No prior coding experience is required, making it perfect for those starting their programming journey.",
  "course_overview": "This course takes you from absolute beginner to capable Python programmer through practical, project-based learning. You will start by setting up your development environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. The curriculum then progresses through Python's fundamental data types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries), control flow (if/else statements, for and while loops), and function creation. You'll work with real-world examples like building a number guessing game, creating a to-do list manager, and writing a script to process and analyze text files. The final module introduces essential libraries and culminates in a capstone project where you will build a personal budget tracker that reads financial data, performs calculations, and generates a summary report. Each concept is reinforced with coding exercises and quizzes to ensure practical understanding.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior programming experience; professionals from non-technical fields (e.g., marketing, finance, academia) seeking to automate tasks; university students requiring programming fundamentals; and hobbyists interested in coding as a new skill.",
