  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "A comprehensive beginner-friendly course designed to introduce the fundamentals of Python programming. You'll learn core concepts like variables, data types, control flow, functions, and basic data structures. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, you'll build a solid foundation for writing effective Python code and be prepared to tackle more advanced topics in software development, data analysis, or automation. No prior coding experience is required.",
  "course_overview": "This course provides a thorough, hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, one of the world's most popular and versatile languages. We start from the absolute basics, guiding you through setting up your development environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. You will then master core programming concepts such as variables, data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), and operators. The course delves into controlling program flow with conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for, while) to create dynamic applications. You will learn to write reusable blocks of code with functions and explore essential data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples to manage collections of data. Practical projects, such as building a simple number guessing game, a basic to-do list application, or a script to analyze a text file, will solidify your understanding and give you the confidence to write your own programs.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior programming experience; professionals from non-technical fields (e.g., marketers, project managers, researchers) seeking to automate tasks or understand code; and students exploring a potential career in software development, data science, or IT.",
