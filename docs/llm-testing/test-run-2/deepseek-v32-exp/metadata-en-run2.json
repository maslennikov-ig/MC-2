  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a comprehensive foundation in Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. You will learn core programming concepts, from basic syntax and data types to writing your own functions and scripts, enabling you to automate tasks, analyze data, and build a solid base for future software development.",
  "course_overview": "This course offers a deep dive into the fundamentals of Python programming. We start with the absolute basics, guiding you through setting up your development environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. You will then master core concepts like variables, data types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries), and control flow using conditionals (if/else statements) and loops (for and while). The course progresses to more complex topics, including defining and calling your own functions to create reusable code blocks, and working with file I/O to read from and write to text files. Practical application is emphasized throughout; for example, you will build a simple number-guessing game, create a script to process and analyze a list of customer orders, and develop a personal contact book that stores and retrieves data. By the end, you will have the confidence and skills to write functional Python scripts to solve real-world problems.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; career changers looking to enter the tech industry; students in non-technical majors seeking to add a valuable skill; data-oriented professionals like analysts or marketers who want to automate repetitive tasks with scripts; and hobbyists interested in understanding how software works.",
