  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-friendly course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python programming, one of the world's most popular and versatile languages. You will build a solid foundation in core programming concepts, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Through hands-on projects and exercises, you'll learn to write clean, efficient Python code for automation, data analysis, and basic application development, setting the stage for further specialization in fields like web development, machine learning, and data science.",
  "course_overview": "This course is your first step into the world of programming with Python. We start from absolute zero, ensuring no prior experience is necessary. You will begin by understanding what programming is and why Python is an excellent first language. The curriculum then dives into foundational concepts: setting up your development environment, mastering basic syntax, and using variables and data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans). You will learn to control the flow of your programs with conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for/while). A significant portion is dedicated to core data structures including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, teaching you how to store, access, and manipulate collections of data. You will then progress to defining and using your own functions to write modular, reusable code, and learn to handle errors gracefully with try-except blocks. The course culminates in practical, hands-on projects, such as building a simple text-based calculator, a number-guessing game, a to-do list manager, and a script to read and analyze a simple text file. By the end, you will have the confidence and skills to tackle real-world problems with Python.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; career-changers exploring tech roles; students from non-technical majors (e.g., business, humanities, arts) seeking a digital skill; administrative professionals and analysts looking to automate repetitive Excel and data tasks; and hobbyists interested in understanding how software works.",
