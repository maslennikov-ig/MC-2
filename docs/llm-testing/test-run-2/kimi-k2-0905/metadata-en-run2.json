{"course_title":"Introduction to Python Programming","course_description":"A hands-on, beginner-friendly technical course that teaches the fundamentals of Python programming through practical exercises and real-world projects. Participants will write code from day one, explore core concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, and data structures, and finish by building a console-based application they can showcase to employers or peers.","course_overview":"The course is structured in four progressive modules. Week 1 focuses on the Python ecosystem: installing Anaconda, using Jupyter Notebook, and writing your first 'Hello, World!' script. Week 2 dives into data types—strings, integers, lists, dictionaries—and control structures like for-loops and if-statements while solving challenges such as FizzBuzz and password strength checkers. Week 3 introduces modularity: you will define reusable functions, import the standard library, and handle exceptions while creating a CSV file parser that summarizes sales data. Week 4 culminates in a capstone project where you design and debug a text-based adventure game that accepts user input, tracks player inventory with sets, and persists high scores to disk using JSON. Along the way, you will practice version control with Git, write docstrings following PEP 8, and unit-test your code with pytest. By the end, you will have a GitHub portfolio containing at least three polished scripts, a README that explains how to run them, and the confidence to automate everyday tasks like renaming batches of files or scraping web pages for data.","target_audience":"Career changers with zero coding background who want to break into tech, analysts who currently use Excel and wish to automate reports, high-school or university students exploring STEM electives, and hobbyists who want to control Raspberry Pi gadgets or create simple games.","estimated_duration_hours":40,"difficulty_level":"beginner","prerequisites":["Basic computer literacy (create folders, install software)","High-school algebra (comfortable with variables and equations)","Access to a computer with administrator rights"],"learning_outcomes":["Install Python 3 and third-party packages with pip in a virtual environment","Build interactive programs that accept user input and validate data types","Create functions with docstrings and unit tests to ensure reliable behavior","Analyze runtime errors using tracebacks and implement try-except blocks","Design programs that read from and write to text, CSV, and JSON files"],"course_tags":["python","programming","beginner","automation","jupyter","git","functions","data structures"]}
