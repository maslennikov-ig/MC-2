  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This comprehensive beginner-level technical programming course provides a solid foundation in Python programming fundamentals. Students will master essential concepts including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and file handling through hands-on exercises and practical projects. The curriculum is designed for absolute beginners with no prior coding experience, progressively building from basic syntax to creating functional applications. Participants will learn to write clean, efficient Python code and develop problem-solving skills applicable across various domains including data analysis, automation, and web development.",
  "course_overview": "The course begins with Python environment setup and basic syntax, covering variables, primitive data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), and collection types (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets). Students will explore control flow through if-else statements, for and while loops, and learn to handle exceptions gracefully. The curriculum delves into function definition, parameters, return values, scope, and lambda functions. File operations include reading from and writing to text files, CSV processing, and working with JSON data. Practical applications feature building a calculator program, creating a text-based adventure game, automating file organization tasks, and developing a simple data analysis script using built-in libraries. Advanced topics introduce list comprehensions, decorators, and an overview of popular libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Each module includes coding exercises, debugging practice, and a capstone project where students design and implement a personal productivity tool. The course emphasizes best practices including code documentation, version control basics with Git, and writing testable code. By completion, students will have a portfolio of 5-7 functional Python programs demonstrating their ability to solve problems programmatically.",
  "target_audience": "This course is designed for: 1) Career changers with no prior programming experience seeking to enter software development roles, 2) University students in non-technical majors (business, humanities, sciences) who need computational skills for research or career enhancement, 3) Working professionals in administrative, analytical, or managerial positions looking to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency through scripting, 4) High school students preparing for computer science studies or technical internships, 5) Entrepreneurs and small business owners wanting to build basic technical prototypes or understand software development processes, 6) Data analysts transitioning from Excel to more powerful programming tools. No mathematical or technical background is required beyond basic computer literacy.",
