  "section_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python programming. Students will learn how to create and manipulate variables, work with different data types including numbers, strings, and booleans, and perform type conversions. Through hands-on exercises, students will gain practical experience in using Python's built-in data types effectively.",
