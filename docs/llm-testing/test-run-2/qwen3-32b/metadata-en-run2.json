  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "A beginner-level technical programming course designed to equip learners with foundational Python skills. Topics include syntax basics, data types, control structures, functions, and file handling, supported by hands-on coding exercises and real-world examples.",
  "course_overview": "This course begins with Python fundamentals such as variables, loops, and conditionals, using examples like building a simple calculator and automating file renaming tasks. Students will progress to creating functions and modules, with projects including a to-do list application and a basic web scraper. The curriculum covers data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples) through practical applications like analyzing sales data, and introduces error handling and debugging techniques via a temperature conversion tool. A final project involves developing a weather forecast application using public APIs, reinforcing integration of concepts like loops, functions, and external libraries. The course emphasizes problem-solving and iterative development, ensuring learners can apply knowledge to scripts for data processing, automation, and small-scale applications.",
  "target_audience": "Aspiring programmers with no prior coding experience, STEM students seeking foundational programming skills, and professionals from non-technical fields aiming to automate workflows.",
