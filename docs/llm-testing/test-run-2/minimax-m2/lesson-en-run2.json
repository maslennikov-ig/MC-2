  "section_description": "This hands-on programming section introduces fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. Students will learn to create, assign, and manipulate variables while exploring numeric types (integers, floats, complex), text strings, boolean values, and None. Through practical exercises and coding challenges, students will develop proficiency in Python's dynamic typing system and understand type conversion methods essential for robust programming.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Create and assign variables using valid Python naming conventions",
    "Distinguish and use different numeric data types (int, float, complex)",
    "Perform string operations including concatenation, indexing, and formatting",
    "Apply boolean logic and understand truthy/falsy values",
    "Implement type conversion functions and identify common type errors",
    "Debug variable-related issues using print statements and type checking"
