  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This comprehensive beginner-level course introduces students to fundamental programming concepts using Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. Designed for absolute beginners with no prior programming experience, the course covers core syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming principles. Students will learn through hands-on projects and practical exercises that build real-world applications. The curriculum emphasizes problem-solving skills, code readability, and best practices in software development. By the end of this course, participants will have the foundation needed to pursue advanced Python topics, data science, web development, or automation projects.",
  "course_overview": "The course begins with Python installation and environment setup, followed by an introduction to variables, data types (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries), and basic operators. Students then progress to control structures including if/else statements, for/while loops, and logical operators. Functions are introduced with parameters, return values, and scope concepts. The course covers file handling operations for reading and writing data, exception handling for error management, and basic data structures manipulation. Object-oriented programming concepts are introduced including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Throughout the course, students work on practical projects such as a calculator application, contact book manager, simple web scraper, and data analysis scripts. The curriculum includes debugging techniques, code testing principles, and introduction to popular Python libraries like requests for HTTP operations and pandas for data manipulation. Each module includes peer code reviews and collaborative programming exercises to reinforce learning through community interaction.",
  "target_audience": "Primary audience includes recent high school graduates interested in pursuing computer science or software development careers, career changers transitioning from non-technical fields to technology roles, professionals seeking to automate repetitive tasks in their current roles (analysts, researchers, administrators), and students in non-computer science majors who need programming skills for research or data analysis projects. Ideal participants have basic computer literacy, can navigate file systems, and possess logical thinking abilities. Previous experience with spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets) or basic math concepts is beneficial but not required. The course is particularly suited for individuals who prefer structured, project-based learning environments and are comfortable with self-paced study combined with instructor guidance.",
