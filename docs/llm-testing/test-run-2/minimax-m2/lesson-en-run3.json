  "section_description": "This hands-on programming section introduces fundamental concepts of variables, data types, and type operations in Python. Students will learn to declare variables following Python naming conventions, work with numeric types (integers and floats), manipulate string data, and apply boolean logic. Through practical coding exercises, students will develop proficiency in type checking, conversion, and data type-specific operations essential for Python programming.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Declare variables using proper Python naming conventions and syntax",
    "Distinguish between integer, float, string, and boolean data types",
    "Perform type checking and conversion operations on different data types",
    "Apply string methods and formatting techniques to manipulate text data",
    "Use boolean expressions and comparison operators in conditional logic",
    "Implement type-specific operations and functions for each fundamental data type"
