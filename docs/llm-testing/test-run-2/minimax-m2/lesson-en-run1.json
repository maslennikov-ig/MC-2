  "section_description": "This hands-on programming section introduces students to fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. Students will learn how to create and manage variables, work with different data types including numeric, string, and boolean values, and understand type conversion and operations. The section emphasizes practical application through coding exercises and real-world examples.",
