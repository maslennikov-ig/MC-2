Learners will define variables, explore mutable and immutable types, perform type conversions, and apply these concepts in practical coding exercises that reinforce best practices for data handling in Python.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Students will be able to declare and assign variables using appropriate naming conventions.",
    "Students will be able to differentiate between mutable and immutable data types and choose the correct type for a given problem.",
    "Students will be able to perform explicit type conversion and handle conversion errors gracefully.",
    "Students will be able to apply variable scope rules in functions and modules."
