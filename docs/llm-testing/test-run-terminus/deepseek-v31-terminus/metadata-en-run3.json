  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a solid foundation in Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. You will start from the absolute basics, learning core programming concepts and syntax, and progressively build towards creating functional applications. The course emphasizes hands-on learning with practical exercises and real-world examples to ensure you gain the confidence to write your own Python scripts.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive course is designed to take you from having no prior programming experience to becoming a confident beginner Python programmer. We begin by exploring the fundamental building blocks of programming, such as variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic operations. You will then learn to control the flow of your programs using conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for/while). A significant portion of the course is dedicated to functions, teaching you how to define your own reusable blocks of code to make your programs more efficient and organized. We will also cover essential data structures like lists for storing collections of items and dictionaries for key-value pairs. The course culminates in a practical project where you will build a simple text-based application, such as a number guessing game or a basic to-do list manager, integrating all the concepts you've learned. Throughout the course, you will use industry-standard tools and learn best practices for writing clean, readable code.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; career-changers looking to enter the tech industry; students in non-technical majors seeking to add programming skills; professionals in fields like marketing, finance, or research who want to automate repetitive tasks and analyze data; and hobbyists interested in understanding how software works.",
