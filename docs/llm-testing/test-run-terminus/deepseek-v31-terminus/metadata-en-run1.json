  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-friendly course provides a solid foundation in Python programming, one of the world's most popular and versatile languages. You will learn core programming concepts, syntax, and practical problem-solving skills through hands-on exercises and projects. By the end, you'll be able to write your own Python scripts, automate simple tasks, and understand the fundamentals needed to pursue more advanced topics in web development, data science, or automation.",
  "course_overview": "This course is designed to take you from absolute beginner to a confident Python programmer. We start by setting up your Python environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. You will then master fundamental concepts like variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic operations. The course delves into controlling program flow with conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for/while), allowing you to create dynamic scripts. You will learn to organize your code using functions and understand the concept of scope. A major focus is placed on data structures; you will work extensively with lists for ordered collections, dictionaries for key-value pairs, and tuples for immutable data. Practical application is emphasized throughout. For example, you will build a number guessing game, a simple text-based calculator, and a program that reads from and writes to a text file. The final project involves creating a basic personal task manager that can add, delete, and list tasks, reinforcing all the concepts learned. The goal is to equip you with the practical skills to solve real-world problems with code.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; career changers looking to enter tech fields like data analysis or software development; students in non-technical majors seeking to add a valuable skill; professionals in fields like marketing or finance who want to automate repetitive tasks and analyze data more effectively.",
