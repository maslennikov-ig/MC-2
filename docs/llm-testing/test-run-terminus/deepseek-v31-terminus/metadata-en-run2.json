  "course_title": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "course_description": "This beginner-level technical programming course provides a solid foundation in Python, one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. You will start from absolute zero, learning core programming concepts like variables, data types, and control flow, and progress to building functional scripts and applications. The course emphasizes hands-on learning with practical exercises, ensuring you gain the confidence to write Python code for automation, data analysis, and basic web development.",
  "course_overview": "This comprehensive course is designed to take you from a complete novice to a confident beginner in Python programming. We begin by setting up your Python development environment and writing your first 'Hello, World!' program. You will then master fundamental concepts such as variables, data types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries), and operators. The course delves into controlling program flow with conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for and while), enabling you to automate repetitive tasks. You will learn to organize your code effectively using functions and modules, promoting reusability and clarity. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to working with data: reading from and writing to files, handling errors with try/except blocks, and using popular libraries. For example, you will build a script that processes a text file to count word frequencies and a simple number-guessing game. By the end, you will have the skills to tackle real-world problems, such as automating file organization or performing basic data analysis with libraries like Pandas.",
  "target_audience": "Absolute beginners with no prior coding experience; professionals from non-technical fields (e.g., marketers, researchers, managers) seeking to automate tasks and analyze data; students exploring a career in software development or data science; and hobbyists interested in understanding how to build simple tools and applications.",
